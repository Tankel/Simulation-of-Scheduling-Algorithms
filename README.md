# Simulation-of-Scheduling-Algorithms
This project is a simulation and performance evaluation of two CPU scheduling algorithms: FCFS (First Come, First Served) and RR (Round Robin). The project was conducted by my partner and me, and the complete article outlining our conclusions, as well as the code, can be found in the repository.

The simulation was designed to test the performance of both algorithms under different conditions and workloads. The FCFS algorithm assigns CPU time to processes based on their arrival time, while the RR algorithm assigns a fixed time quantum to each process in a cyclic manner.

The simulation allowed us to observe how the two algorithms perform in terms of turnaround time, waiting time, and response time for different process sets and time quantum values. Based on our analysis, we were able to draw conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

The full article, which is written in Spanish, provides a detailed explanation of our methodology, results, and conclusions. Additionally, the repository contains the source code for the simulation, which can be used for further research or experimentation.

We hope that our work will be useful for those interested in CPU scheduling algorithms, and we invite you to explore our repository and article for more information.
